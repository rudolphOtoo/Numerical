Imagine you have two polynomials:

**Dividend**: This is the polynomial you want to divide (think of it as the number you're trying to split).
**Divisor**: This is the polynomial you're dividing by (think of it like the size of each piece you're splitting into).
The **goal** is to find the quotient (result of the division) and the remainder.

**Steps:**

**Initialize variables:**
Set the quotient to an empty polynomial (no terms yet).
Set the remainder to the dividend (initially, we haven't divided anything).


**Loop through the dividend's terms:**
Start from the highest degree term in the dividend.
Divide this term by the highest degree term of the divisor.
The result of this division becomes a term in the quotient.
Multiply the divisor by this term from the quotient.
Subtract this product from the current remainder.
Update the remainder with the result of the subtraction.
